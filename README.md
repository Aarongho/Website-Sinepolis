# 🍿🎬✨ Sinéfolis Cinemas Website

## 📂 Project Overview
This project develops a **responsive website** for **Sinéfolis Cinemas**, a premium global chain of movie theaters.  
The website is designed to bring the **luxurious cinematic experience online**, making it easy for customers to explore showtimes, check promos, discover cinemas, and give feedback.

The project is divided into two parts:
1. **Prototype Design (Figma):** A design prototype with consistent theme but intentionally different layout from the final website.  
2. **Final Website (HTML, CSS, JS):** Fully functional and responsive website.
